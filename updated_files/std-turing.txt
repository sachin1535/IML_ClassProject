WHAT IS THE CRITERIA 
Perhaps the Turing Test.

WHAT IS THE IMITATION GAME 
The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows
them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must
always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'

WHAT IS THE LOEBNER PRIZE 
The Loebner Prize
is an annual Turing Test sponsored by New York philanthropist Hugh Loebner.  Dr. Wallace and ALICE won 

WHAT IS THE TURIG TEST 

WHAT IS THE TURING * 
Turing described his original "Game" in "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," Mind, Vol. Lix, No. 236 (1950). Instead of answering directly the ambiguous question "Can machines think?" Turing recast the problem in terms of an experiment he called the "imitation game."

WHAT IS THE TURING GAME 

WHAT IS THE TURING TEST 
The "Turing Test" is the name given to a variety of experiments designed to test computer thinking.  Whole conferences are dedicated to the question of what Turing meant in his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," where he proposed the idea of an "imitation game" to decide the question, "Can machines think?"
